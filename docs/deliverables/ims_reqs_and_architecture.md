# Information System Requirements and Architecture for GPT AI Chatbot

1. **User Volume and Scalability**
   - **Requirement:** The system should be able to handle an average of 2500 students per campus.
   - **Scalability Plan:** Implement auto-scaling groups to handle increased load. Use load balancers to distribute traffic efficiently.

2. **Data Sources and Integration**
   - **Academic Advice:**
     - **Internal University Databases:** Integrate with the university’s academic database to access course details, schedules, academic resources, and faculty contacts.
     - **External Educational Resources:** Integrate APIs from educational platforms like Khan Academy, Coursera, or edX for additional learning materials.
   - **Career Counseling:**
     - **University Career Services:** Integrate with the university's career services database for career advice, resume tips, and job application processes.
     - **External Job Portals:** Use APIs from job portals like Indeed, LinkedIn, or Glassdoor to fetch job listings and internship opportunities relevant to technology careers.
   - **Internship Opportunities:**
     - **University Internship Programs:** Connect with the university’s internship programs database to provide students with available internship opportunities.
     - **Industry Partnerships:** Integrate with industry partner APIs that offer internships specifically for students in technology sectors.

3. **Security and Compliance**
   - **FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act):**
     - **Data Encryption:** Encrypt all student data both at rest and in transit.
     - **Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can access student data.
     - **Audit Trails:** Maintain detailed audit logs of data access and modifications.
   - **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**
     - **Data Minimization:** Collect only the necessary data required for the chatbot’s functionality.
     - **User Consent:** Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting and processing their data.
     - **Right to Access and Erasure:** Ensure users can request access to their data and have the option to delete their data from the system.

4. **Performance and Availability**
   - **Infrastructure:** Use cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for reliable infrastructure.
   - **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, New Relic) to track system performance and set up alerts for any issues.
   - **Backup and Recovery:** Regularly back up data and have a disaster recovery plan in place.

5. **User Interaction and Feedback**
   - **Logging:** Implement basic logging mechanisms to record user interactions, such as questions asked, responses given, and any errors encountered.
   - **Analytics:** Use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) to analyze user interaction logs and generate insights.

### Information System Architecture

Based on these requirements, here's a high-level architecture outline:

1. **Frontend Interface:** A web or mobile app interface where users interact with the chatbot.
2. **Chatbot Engine:** The core engine powered by OpenAI's GPT integrated with Perplexity for advanced query handling.
3. **Backend Services:**
   - **Data Integration Layer:** Handles integration with internal and external data sources using APIs.
   - **Database:** Airtable for storing structured data like user interactions, academic resources, and internship listings.
   - **Workflow Automation:** Make.com for automating workflows between different services.
4. **Security Layer:** Implement encryption, access controls, and compliance checks.
5. **Logging and Analytics:** Basic logging for interactions with analytics tools for research and insights.
6. **Scalability and Performance Management:** Cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling and load balancing to manage user load.
